# Covid19_Xray Covid 19 detection using X-Ray Images

Here four models are designed for Covid-19 detections from X-ray Images. these models are
1. Covid-19 detection using CNN-CapsNet model as 2 class problem (Covid Vs. Non-Covid)
2. Covid-19 detection using CNN-CapsNet model as 2 class problem (Covid Vs. Normal Vs. Viral Pneumonia)
3. Covid-19 detection using VGG16-CapsNet model as 2 class problem (Covid Vs. Non-Covid)
4. Covid-19 detection using VGG16-CapsNet model as 2 class problem (Covid Vs. Normal Vs. Viral Pneumonia)


The Coid-19 X-ray image dataset used in this work is collected by Andrew by following web Italian Society of Medical and Interventional Radiology (SIRM), Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) and Radiopaedia.
Andrew M V Dadario. (n.d.). COVID-19 X rays. Kaggle. https://doi.org/10.34740/KAGGLE/DSV/1019469.

for 2 class problem (Covid Vs. Non-Covid), images from Normal and Viral Pneumonia classes are grouped into Non-Covid class.
